=abcd= is a simple [[https://facebook.github.io/planout/][planout]] based allocation server for online experiments.

** Usage
*** Installation
=abcd= is not on pypi as of yet. You need to manually install from this
repository.

*** Workflow
Write experiments in planout script, compile to json, and keep in an sqlite
database with schema specified in =schema.sql=. Then run the server pointing to
this database.

#+begin_quote
Compiling planout script to json needs planout.js and can be used as following:

=node ./planout/compiler/planout.js input.planout > output.json=
#+end_quote

As an example, try running the following which loads a test database namespace
and a simple color selection experiment:

#+begin_src shell
poetry run abcd ./tests/assets/db.sqlite
#+end_src

Then you can query for allocation using the following:

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results output
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"params":{"id": 223}}' http://localhost:8813/allocate/test
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {"color":"blue"}
